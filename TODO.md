# To Do

* [Dynamic predicates and responses](http://www.mbtest.org/docs/api/injection).
* Retrieve impostors from a running MB instance, and hydrate.
* What if Mountebank is installed elsewhere? We should emit better messages if starting the mb server fails, and make the location configurable. This could be as simple as parameterising it.
